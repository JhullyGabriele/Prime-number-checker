# Prime Number Checker
Prime Number Checker in C

I developed a simple application in the C programming language to verify whether a given number is prime. The program first prompts the user to enter an integer value. It then performs successive division attempts from 1 up to the number itself, checking whether the remainder of each division is zero. Whenever the number is evenly divisible, a counter variable is incremented to track the total number of divisors.

At the end of the process, the program evaluates the counter value: if the number has exactly two divisors, it is classified as a prime number, since prime numbers are defined as being divisible only by 1 and themselves. Otherwise, the program reports that the number is not prime.

This project demonstrates fundamental programming concepts such as control structures, loops, conditional logic, arithmetic operations, and algorithmic reasoning in C, with emphasis on mathematical validation and problem-solving.
