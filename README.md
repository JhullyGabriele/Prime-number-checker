# Prime Number Checker in C

A simple **C program** to determine whether a given integer is a prime number.  

The program works as follows:  
1. Prompts the user to enter an integer.  
2. Iteratively checks all numbers from 1 up to the entered number to see if they divide it evenly.  
3. Counts the total number of divisors.  
4. Determines if the number is prime: a number with exactly **two divisors** (1 and itself) is classified as prime; otherwise, it is not prime.

## Features
- Demonstrates fundamental programming concepts in C:  
  - Loops and control structures  
  - Conditional statements  
  - Arithmetic operations  
  - Algorithmic reasoning  
- Simple and clear logic for prime number verification.  

## How It Works
- The program increments a counter each time a divisor is found.  
- After checking all potential divisors, it evaluates the counter:  
  - **2 divisors → prime**  
  - **Other → not prime**

## Purpose
This project is ideal for learning and practicing:  
- Algorithm design  
- Problem-solving in C  
- Basic numerical and mathematical validation
